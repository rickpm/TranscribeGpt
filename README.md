# Ask Me a Question

This web application allows users to ask questions and receive responses using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The application records audio input from the user, uploads it to AWS S3, transcribes the audio, and sends the transcript to the GPT-3.5 model for generating a response.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js: The runtime environment for running the server-side application.
- npm (Node Package Manager): Used to install the required packages and manage dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ask-me-a-question
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

### AWS Setup

The application uses AWS S3 to store audio files and retrieve transcripts. Follow these steps to set up your AWS credentials:

1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one already.

2. Obtain your AWS access key ID and secret access key.

3. Configure your AWS CLI or set environment variables with the following values:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
   export AWS_REGION=<your-aws-region>
   export S3_BUCKET_NAME=<your-s3-bucket-name>
   ```

### OpenAI API Setup

The application uses the OpenAI API to interact with the GPT-3.5 model. Follow these steps to set up your OpenAI API key:

1. Create an OpenAI account if you don't have one already.

2. Generate an API key from the OpenAI dashboard.

3. Add your API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Click on the "Click to Ask" button to start recording your question. The button will turn red and display "Click again to stop" while recording.

4. After you finish speaking, the application will upload the recorded audio to AWS S3, transcribe the audio, and send the transcript to the GPT-3.5 model for generating a response.

5. The response will be displayed in the response container below the recording button.

6. Click the recording button again to ask another question.

## Customization

- You can customize the appearance and behavior of the web application by modifying the CSS styles in the HTML file (`index.html`) and the JavaScript code in the client-side script (`public/script.js`).

- Adjust the media queries in the CSS styles to make the application responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

- Modify the GPT-3.5 model settings by changing the `max_tokens` and `model` parameters in the `sendToChatGPT` function in the client-side script (`public/script.js`).
